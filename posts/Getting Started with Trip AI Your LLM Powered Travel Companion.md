# Getting Started with Trip AI - Your LLM-Powered Travel Companion

## Overview
Trip AI harnesses the power of Large Language Models to transform your travel planning experience. Whether you're planning a weekend getaway or a two-week adventure, Trip AI helps you create detailed, personalized itineraries with just a few clicks. In this guide, we'll explore how to use Trip AI and make the most of its features.

## Problem and Motivation
Traditional travel planning often involves juggling multiple tabs, cross-referencing reviews, and manually organizing schedules. Trip AI streamlines this process by leveraging LLMs to generate comprehensive itineraries while giving you full control over the details. The best part? You can try it right now at [Trip AI](https://atharva2099.github.io/Trip.AI/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Setting Up Access
There are two ways to get started with Trip AI:

#### Direct Usage

2. Get a free Groq API key from [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
3. Enter your API key when prompted (stored locally in your browser)

#### Local Development
```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Atharva2099/Trip.AI.git
cd Trip AI

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add your Groq API key to .env file
echo "REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

```

#### Interactive Customization
Don't like a suggested activity? No problem! Every element of your itinerary is customizable:

## Pro Tips

   - The cost breakdown helps you track spending across categories

2. **Customization Tricks**
   ```text
   
   Some effective modification requests:
   - "Find a cheaper alternative to this activity"
   - "Suggest a more local restaurant instead"
   - "Move this activity to earlier in the day"
   - "Find something more kid-friendly"
   
   ```

3. **Location Management**
